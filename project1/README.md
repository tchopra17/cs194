# Tushar Chopra's Project 1: Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection
For this project, I took the work of Prokudin-Gorskii and colorized it. Prokudin-Gorskii took pictures using 3 filters, Red, Green and Blue. I took those 3 filtered images, cropped them and aligned them to produce a singular colored image. I also added another feature which took the resulting images, mapped the histogram of the intensity values, and normalized them so that each picture had a consitent contrast level. This resulted in images that were more vibrant and clear.

## The code
The notebook, testing.ipynb, contains all the code needed to run this project. Each function is commented with its description. Simply run the labelled cells to get the desired outputs.
